Its goal is to select 10 random words from a giant dictionary and the player must write them as quickly and accurately as possible. 

After that, their speed, number of errors and time spent are displayed. It’s pretty cool.

Why would you need this game? (strange question, but ok)

At the very least, it’s for developing typing speed. 

Typing speed is the ability to quickly and accurately type text on a computer keyboard or other device. Typing can be a useful skill in the modern world where information is transmitted digitally and requires prompt processing. 
Typing helps save time, increase productivity, improve work quality and avoid errors. Typing also contributes to the development of memory, attention, logic and creativity. 

Typing is not only a convenient tool but also a valuable resource for personal and professional growth. 
So no matter how useless this game may seem, it’s definitely better than your TikToks…
